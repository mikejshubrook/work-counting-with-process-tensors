# Work counting with process tensors

This project calculates numerically exact quantum work statistics with process tensors.

# Project Overview
This code was used to calculate the results in (link to paper).

# Initial setup
To run the code, follow these instructions:
TODO

Create the data folders by running (within 'data' folder) bash setup_data_folder.sh

Run the dynamics test by running (within 'tests' folder) bash run-dynamics-tests-plots.sh This will ensure that the code is able to run on your machine. It will first create an influence functional and then run the system dynamics, and finally it will plot these dynamics.

Run the WCF test by running (within 'tests' folder) bash run-wcf-tests-plots.sh This will calculate the WCF using the same parameters used to calculate the influence functional and system dynamics from the previous test. 

To see if your tests have run properly, compare the outputted figures to the files within the 'tests' folder names 'expected-dynamics.png' and 'expected-wcf.png'

# Tests

# Example usage
I have uploaded video tutorials on my YouTube channel explaining both how the code works, and how to use it.
